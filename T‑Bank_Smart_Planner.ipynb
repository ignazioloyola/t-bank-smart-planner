        "\n",
        "Create a concise, well‑structured specification document (PDF or shared Google Doc) that captures the entire scope of the Smart Planner feature. The document should include: a brief executive summary of the project’s purpose and expected business impact; clearly defined user personas (Casual and Business) with their goals and pain points; a set of user stories grouped by persona, each written in the “As a … I want … so that …” format and accompanied by acceptance criteria; the key quantitative and qualitative success metrics; a short list of non‑functional requirements (usability, performance, security, integration); and a simple state‑transition diagram describing task statuses (New → In Waiting → In Progress → Completed/Cancelled → Archived) plus any optional transitions (e.g., Postponed, Paused). End with a MoSCoW‑style prioritisation table and a brief risk‑mitigation matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "Follow the company style guide (headings, bullet points, page numbers) and keep the whole specification to **no more than three pages** (excluding optional appendices). After drafting, circulate the document to the Product Owner, UX Lead, and Engineering Lead for a quick review, incorporate their feedback, and then publish the final version as version 1.0 in the project’s shared folder. This concise spec will serve as the single source of truth for design, development, and QA teams to build the Smart Planner feature."
